Great to know you stated learning blockchain development. And thanks for choosing to pursue your goal of becoming a [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) smart contract developer though this awesome [Web3 Mastery](https://web3mastery.org) Solidity tutorial series.

This tutorial series is a strategic resource that was created in line with a carefully crafted curriculum, to enable learners get a foundation understanding of building smart contracts with Solidity. The series covers Solidity from basic/general programming concepts like data types, variables, functions and more, into deeper and more Solidty-specific concepts like storage, addresses and more.

By the end of this course, you should be armed with sufficient knowledge to help you pursue your career goal as a Solidity smart contract engineer on Ethereum.

Please note that this article is not a deep-dive introduction into the Solidity programming language(We'll have a deep-dive in the next article). This article is meant to serve as a guide to help you make the best of the series.

## The Solidity Programming Language.

Solidity is the default/native programming for building smart contracts on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) blockchain.

> Smart contracts are autonomous computer programs that are executed in a decentralized manner - without the need of a centralized or third-party entity. They are basically sets of computer codes that control the execution of agreements/transactions on top of blockchains.

Despite the availability of other competing blockchains, Ethereum still holds the largest share of the blockchain ecosystem in terms of decentralized/onchain activities - most of which is powered by smart contract written in Solidity.

I must assure that you decision to become a Solidity blockchain developer is definitely an awesome one.

## Course requirements.

1. To follow along with this tutorial series, it is highly recommended that you have some programming knowledge. At least a basic knowledge of some web development essentials like HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

**Learning Solidity as a first programming language is certainly something I won't recommend.**

Your programming knowledge doesn't have to be along the web development path, it's just fine as long as you already have experience programming with any language - especially one that is both statically and strongly typed.

> Knowing Javascript is certainly not a compulsory requirement for this series, neither is a must before one can pursue a career in blockchain development(ESPECIALLY IF YOUR INTEREST IN WEB3 IS TO BECOME A SMART-CONTRACT-ONLY DEVELOPER). But considering how much Javascript is used in the smart contract development world(especially in testing and interacting with smart contracts), it will certainly be beneficial to take a pause and learn some Javascript first before returning to proceed with this course. 

[This awesome Web3 Mastery article](https://www.web3mastery.org/posts/tutorials/how-to-learn-solidity-in-2024) shares more details on the 'learn Javascript first' argument. And will also serve as a very valuable guide to help your journey of becoming a Solidity smart contract developer.

2. Secondly, to follow along with this tutorial series, you should have a good understanding of some blockchain/web3 fundamentals.

You should at least have some basic knowledge of the following:

- What blockchains are, and how they work.
- Fundamental underlying blockchain concepts like cryptography, hashing, blocks, mining, nodes, blockchain reward systems(proof of work[POW] and proof of stake[POS]) and more other concepts that reveal how blockchains work.
- Wallets, private and public keys, blockchain transactions, and as much more as possible.

Having all of these fundamental knowledge, will be very vital in helping you better understand things as the course proceeds.

Without doubt, you will certainly come across some or all of these foundational blockchain/web3 terms as we continue.

## Conclusion.

With all of these points checkout out, you can proceed on your journey into the rabbit-hole of smart contract engineering with the Solidity programming language.

Wishing  you a great learning experience.

See you in the next article.

Cheers!
