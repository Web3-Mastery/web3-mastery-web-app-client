2024 has been the return year of the web3 bull-run. Who else are the ones powering the movement - software engineers of course.

Bull-run seasons are usually interesting moments for web3 engineers. With the continous thrive of web3 and 
crypto in 2024, It's certainly a great time to be a web3 developer. 

Whether you're already a web3/blockchain developer or you intend to become one in 2024, this article will serve as a priceless guide 
towards helping you build an irresistible blockchain developer portfolio.

The engineering scope of the portfolio intended in this article, is **"full-stack"**. This means that you'd require front-end 
development, back-end development, and smart contract development knowledge - using Etherum(with Solidity) as the 
prefered blockchain network.

> The question about which blockchain network to specialize in, is a discussion for another article. 
But if I'm to give a quick unexplained answer(totally my opinion though), I'll say "stick with building on Ethereum"

This articles seeks to offer a complete guide to anyone who wishes to know how to go about building a web3 developer portfolio 
that is robust enough to comfortably lead to irresistible offers from different companies.

**In the article, you'll also find project recommendations to help you follow through and build some solid protfolio projects.**

> Please note that it is not compulsory for anyone to know all the tools or to build all the listed projects in this article,
before they proceed to start applying to jobs. As you read on, you'll easily tell at what point you are good enough
to begin sending out applications.

## A summary

The term **"robust web3/blockchain developer portfolio"** as contained in this article, emphasizes the need to first become a 
generalist web3/blockchain developer before specializing in certain specific aspects of blockchain development. The idea here
builds on summarizing a prescribed blockchain development roadmap, while showing actionable steps to take, so as to
learn and build relevant projects to help master the listed technologies at each level.

A person with such a robust portfolio, will be a perfect fit for any blockchain developer role - of course with Solidity on
Ethereum.

Please note that this guide is not restricted to only Ethereum and Solidity. As will be seen, the pattern in this article can be 
applied to build a robust blockchain development portfolio on any other blockchain protocol - with any desired programming language
and/or set of tools.

### My prescribed blockchain developer road-map, can be summarized as follows:

1. Understanding blockchain fundamentals, and working with basic smart contracts. 
2. Working with more complex smart contracts, and using external development tools - Like [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/), 
[Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/), an oracles like
[Chainlink](https://chain.link/), and other platforms like [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/), [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/), 
[Fleek](https://fleek.xyz/), [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/). Moralis, Wagmi and 
[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/).
3. Working with ERC-20 Tokens: building, deploying and interacting with ERC-20 tokens - especially using
[OpenZepellin](https://www.openzeppelin.com/).
4. Working with Defi(decentralized finance): buiding decentralized protocols/platforms like exchanges, swaps, P2P platforms, 
lending and yield-farmings platforms, and also interacting with protocols like [Aave](https://aave.com/), 
[Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) and more.
5. Working with ERC-721 Tokens(NFTs - Non-Fungible Tokens): building, deploying and interacting with NFT smart contracts, 
NFT marketplaces, and other platforms that supports the use of NFTs - also possibly using OpenZepellin.
6. Working with upgrade-able smart contracts: building, deploying and interacting with upgrade-able smart contracts, also 
possibly using OpenZepellin.
7. Working with DAOs(Decentralized Autonomous Organizations): building, deploying and interacting with DAO smart 
contracts, also possibly using OpenZepellin.
8. A solid knowledge of some **highly important** blockchain practices like: smart 
contract security and auditing, gas optimization techniques, and more senior blockchain development knowledge 
such as understanding and using Assembly languages like Huff and Yul. 
9. Bringing all the Web3-core(aspects listed in points 1 - 8 above) to life through full-stack web or mobile applications - 
which will require a solid knowledge of fullstack development and some Cloud + DevOps skills.
 
> I can already imagine you wondering if this isn't too much. Well, This is what it takes to build the kind of robust 
developer portfolio that is intended in this article. 
> Please note that as earlier mentioned, you absolutely do not have to know all of the above to be an exceptional blockchain developer,
or before you can start applying to jobs.
<mark>Knowing them simply gives you the super-powers to become an irresistibly exceptional web3/blockchain engineer</mark> .

> Also note that all of these and more can be learned for free in the: [Learn Blockchain, Solidity, and Full Stack Web3 Development 
with JavaScript – 32-Hour Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ&pp=ygUSMzIgaG91cnNlIHNvbGlkaXR5) by 
 [Patrick Collins](https://twitter.com/PatrickAlphaC).
> The course is available for free on Youtube.

 – 32-Hour Course'](/post-image_03.png)

 Now, let's explore each aspect in a deeper context.


## 1. Understanding blockchain fundamentals, and working with basic smart contracts.

At this level, the goal is to secure a solid knowledge of blockchain fundamentals, and to also master Solidity by
gaining a solid understanding of the available data types, the syntax, and the different patterns used in developing smart 
contracts with it.

You should do well to get comfortable with writing/building a lot of smart contracts with the 
[Remix Ethereum IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/), exploring deployment to multiple chains(testnets), and to also learn as much 
contract-optimization and gas-saving techniques as you possibly can.

![remix IDE screenshot](/post-image_14.png)
*screenshot: the Remix Ethereum IDE*

Proceed to learn how to build smart contracts in a local development environment or code-editor of your choice(compiling them with 
[Solcjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/solc-js) or any other alternatives), while also learning how to write scripts
(with [Ethersjs](https://docs.ethers.org/)) to deploy your smart contracts - from the local environment.

Some other important things to learn at this stage are: interacting with your smart contracts locally using Ethersjs, and 
basic wallet connection/interaction using metamask. 

This level should set you up quite well - giving you enough confidence. 

However, you shouldn't go looking for jobs just yet.

> Recommended project(s):
>
> 1. Build an e-commerce website that has blockchain(cryptocurrency) based payment. You can deploy the smart contract to 
multiple EVM chains, and have users select the chain(token) they wish to pay with. 
> 2. Build a simple P2P(pair-to-pair) web app with which users can send and recieve cryto to/from any external address, or to/from 
other users within the app. You can also deploy the contracts here on multiple chains.
>
> You might need to get some external data for price conversions, do feel free to do all of that off-chain for now.

Feel free to make the projects as robust as possible - bringing in as much of web2 as your possibly can, so as to make them 
robust enough for your portfolio.

## 2. Working with more complex smart contracts, and using external development tools.

At this point, your confidence level is high, and you're already feeling like a blockchain master. But the journey only just
started.

Now you can move into exploring smart contract development suites and building more complex multi-file/multi-library
smart contracts. 

> Smart contract suites, are development framework/tools that provides blockchain developers with the necessary stack of 
tools they need to work with smart contracts. They are simply all-in-one tools for developing, testing, deploying and even 
interacting with smart contracts.

Your choice of a smart contract development suite should be one of either Hardhat or Foundry.

At the moment, Foundry seems to be more trendy and popular, which makes it a more desirable option. Hardhat remains a great 
option as well - I actually struggle with knowing which of the two to recommend.

![foundry website screenshot](/post-image_16.png)

Feel free to choose any one of the two. You'll need to learn the other once you're comfortable with whichever you choose now, that
way, you'll be very versatile and more employable.

> These suites are not new programming languages or some super-complex engineering tools. The main stuff you'll need to 
work with either of them is the programming language - Solidity(which you should already know at this point). So don't 
feel scared that you'll still need to learn the other.

At this point and as listed above, you'll need to learn how to use some other important tools. You'll need Chainlink for 
decentralized on-chain/off-chain and cross-chain interractions, Filecoin(IPFS for now) for decentralized file storage, 
and maybe Fleek, for hosting static-only website - so as to enable you build "fully decentraized" projects.

For Chainlink you should learn how to use the following services:

1. [Chainlink Datafeeds](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds): for getting decentralized off-chain data.
2. [Chainlink VRF](https://docs.chain.link/vrf): for generating verifiable on-chain randomness(a random number) for use 
in smart contracts.
3. [Chainlink CCIP](https://chain.link/cross-chain): A protocol for cross-chain interactions.

Those three, should do for now. You might need to learn one or more later.

You should learn also how to use The Graph, for accessing indexed on-chain data e.g. events(event data) emitted by your smart contracts 
during user interractions. To use the Graph, you'll need to know [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/).

By now, you should also be making decisions about which layer-2 blockchain(s) you will prefer to continue working with. If you ask 
my opinion, I'll say "stick with Polygon". 

After choosing your prefered L2 chain, proceed with learning and mastering the service provisions available on that chain. 

Finally, you should learn more robust tools like [Moralis](https://moralis.io/), and/or [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) - for proper/more 
robust interactions with your smart contracts on the front-end.

![the graph website screenshot](/post-image_15.png)
*screenshot: the graph website*

> Recommended project(s):
>
> 1. Build a **fully decentralized multi-chain** chat app having **cross-chain** web3 features like P2P transfers, 
token swapping, and lending.
>
> For this project, you will need a solid knowledge of gas-optimization techniques.

> <mark>At this stage, you are definitely ready to begin looking for smart-contract development job.</mark>

## 3. Working with ERC-20 Tokens.

In simple terms, ERC-20 tokens are non-default blockchain tokens/currencies. They are fungible tokens that can be created, 
managed and distributed for different purposes like governace, representation of real-world assets, to serve as a 
stable coin, etcetera. 

Example of ERC-20 tokens are [Tether](https://tether.to/en/)(a stable coin), [Shiba Inu](https://shibatoken.com/), 
[Dai](https://makerdao.com/en/), or even layer-2 blockchain tokens like [MATIC(for Polygon)](https://polygon.technology/),
and [ARB(for Arbitrum)](https://arbitrum.io/).

> Isn't the ability/power(as a blockchain developer) to create such awesome assets a thrilling reality? - it sure is.

Now it's time for you to proceed with buiding your own ERC-20 token.

You should start by first exploring the [EIP-20 documentation provided by Ethereum](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) to 
learn as much about ERC-20s as you possibly can. Then proceed with any available guide, to **first** build/hard-code your own 
ERC-20 token from scratch - by following all the relevant laid down specifications.

After this, you should proceed to explore building an ERC-20 token with OpenZeppelin.

> OpenZeppelin is a platform that helps developers build smart contracts faster. By hooking into their provided 
libraries(their ERC-20 token library/libraries in this case), you can easily build an ERC-20 token in a matter of minutes.

![openzeppelin screenshot](/post-image_17.png)

> Recommended project(s):
>
> 1. After folowing up to this point, you should have built and deployed two ERC-20 tokens(the one built from scratch, and the one
built with OpenZeppelin). Which should be enough.
>
> You can however proceed to learn more about the uses of ERC-20 tokens(e.g for governance), and create a more realistic one to 
serve one of those purposes.

## 4. Working with Defi(decentralized finance) and Defi protocols

At this level(if you're following through) you're already a promising blockchain/web3 professional.

You mission at this stage is to master how to build your own Defi protocol/platform from scratch, or by hooking into libraries
provided by top Defi platforms like [AAVE](https://aave.com/) - for lending/borrowing, [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) -  for 
swapping currencies, and more other relevant Defi platforms - as you will decide.

![uniswap screenshot](/post-image_18.png)

The mission here is staigth-forward: "to earn and master Defi" 

> Recommended project(s):
>
> 1. You can choose to dare the bigger challenge of building your own Defi protocol from scratch, but I'll recommend that you
explore AAVE and Uniswap and build a platform that combines lending/borrowing with cryptocurrency swapping.
>
> After finishing this project, you can then choose to proceed with building your own Defi platform/protocol from scratch - 
if you wish.

## 5. Working with ERC-721 Tokens(NFTs - Non-Fungible Tokens)

ERC-721 tokens are what we popularly call NFTs(Non fungible tokens). NFTs, just like ERC-20 tokens are normal tokens created
with smart contracts, but in this case, they cannot be split into smaller units or duplicated. They are whole and unique
as describe in the [EIP-721 token-standard document](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721).

Just as was the case with the ERC-20s section above, you should begin by building your first NFT(smart contract) from scratch. 
Then proceed to learn how to implement the same - faster with the help of OpenZeppelin.
 
> Recommended project(s):
>
> 1. At this point, you should have built, deployed, and minted two ERC-721 tokens. That should do for the token part.
> 2. Build a decentralized NFT marketplace where user can sell/buy, and swap NFTs(NFT for NFT, and NFT for crypto or fiat)

## 6. Working with upgrade-able smart contracts

Indeed, smart contracts can be upgraded. More detail on that will come in another article.

Your mission here is to learn and master all you can about upgrade-able smart contracts, build and practice upgrading some, and 
ensure to be as job ready as possible - with regards to working with upgrade-able contracts.

> Recommended project(s):
>
> 1. Practice upgrading as many of the smart contract you've previously built.


## 7. Working with DAOs(Decentralized Autonomous Organizations)

The assignment here is also straigth-forward. Your mission is to learn and master how to build DAO smart contracts. 

Even though OpenZeppelin have smart contracts to help with this, it's still a wise choice to build yours from scratch first.
So proceed to explore and build your first DAO smart contract from scratch. After which you can re-implement it faster with the help
of OpenZepellin.

> Recommended project(s):
> 1. Build a DAO, for the purpose of governing any web3 community or protocol you choose.
> 2. Build an ERC-20 token for the DAO, and learn how to launch the token for the purpose of governance in the DAO.

## 8. A solid knowledge of some **highly/very important** blockchain practices(security and gas optimization).

> Two of these crucial areas are: Blockchain(smart contract) security and smart contract optimization in terms
of gas usage.

The highly sensitive nature of blockchains(in smart contracts) make it very important that high security measure are taken, to
prevent unfortunate hacks that leads to loss of user funds. 

**Web3 security is big deal.** 

This remains the reason why blockchain auditing contests/bug-bounties are becoming very popular - with companies willing to 
invest thousands(maybe even millions) of US dollars to have their smart contracts audited in search for vulnerabilities.

> Investing time to gain smart contract security knowledge/skills will only make you even more indispensable as a blockchain 
developer. You definitely want to do that - especially to enable you build highly secure smart contracts in the first place.
You can also earn a lot of money by competing in bug bounties/smart-contract audits, or by working as a smart contract 
security analyst/researcher. You can checkout platforms like [Codehawks](https://www.codehawks.com/) and 
[Code4rena](https://code4rena.com/) for more on smart contract auditing.

With respect to web3 security, I really wish to applaud the works of [Patrick Collins](https://twitter.com/PatrickAlphaC) and 
the awesome team at [Cyfrin](https://www.cyfrin.io/) for all their efforts towards ensuring improved security in the 
global web3 space. All their labours are pricesless.

![the graph website screenshot](/post-image_19.png)

One other very critical aspect in smart contract engineering, is the issue of gas-usage. It only makes sense to invest everything
possible into learning the skills, tips, and tricks that enables you build less expensive smart contracts.

Building protocols that are not gas efficient will only lead to needless waste of funds both for companies and users of the protocols.
It is also simply true that users will avoid using web3 protocols/platforms that cost higher.

> One way to obtain high gas-efficiency, is to build smart contracts at the low-level by using assembly languages like 
[Huff](https://docs.huff.sh/) or [Yul](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/yul.html).
You certainly want to invest time into learning one or both of them.

![the graph website screenshot](/post-image_20.png)

As a smart contract/blockchain developer, it is very crucial to take security and smart-contract gas-efficiency into account. 
A good knowledge of these things will only contribute to making you a more indipensabe web3 software engineer.

## 9. Fullstack web2, With Cloud and DevOps

As awesome as smart contracts are, the fact cannot be disputed that they are from another version of the web(web3) that is both 
technically demanding, and also not quite easily accessible to the regular internet user.

Asides having all these stellar web3 skill, You will only become more valued if you're able to also overlap and bring in your web2 
skills. Having skills like front-end development, fullstack development, cloud administration/managent, and some DevOps knowledge
will not only increase your chances of getting hired, but also increase the possible pay check you will recieve as a developer.

> It should be clearly noted, that having all of theses skills is however not compulsory. You are adviced not to rush through
this list in a bid to learn all the technologies listed here, as that will only leave you partially made, which will in-turn affect 
you employability.

## Wrapping up

You finally made it to the end of the article. Thanks for sticking through to this point.

I trust that this article will serve as a very helpful guide to the many aspiring blockchain developers out there. Even same,
to those who are already into the craft.

> blockchain development is one very interesting field that I'll recommend to any aspiring software engineer. With 
the current bull-run and a very bright future ahead for web3, it is truly a beautitful time to be a web3 software engineer.

Wishing every aspiring blockchain developer the best as they embark on their journey into the **"rabbit-hole"**.

Cheers!!!
