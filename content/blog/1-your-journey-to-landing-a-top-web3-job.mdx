The web3 space, is just one awesome space. The main reason why I totally agree with this, is the uniqueness and beautiful ingeniuty 
of the underlying technology that powers this space - **blockhain technology**.

2024 has been the return-year of the long-awaited web3/crypto bull-run.

[Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/) hit a new all-time high of over $70k - mighty thanks to the impact of the newly launched Bitcoin ETFs, 
[Ethereum(Ether)](https://ethereum.org/en/) currently sits comfortably at over $4K, and [Solana](https://solana.com/) is also 
doing great at just around $170.

All these are indicators of a great time in the crypto space.

## Bull-runs simply mean - 'more jobs'. But...

With bull-runs, come more openings for hiring - hence more jobs.

Even though the current state of the global tech market was really affected by recent issues - especially by the Layoff-drama of 
previous months, the current web3 bull-run still looks very promising.

Just Like AI, Web3 is one other space to niche on if job-security is your goal within the next few years - and likely many more years to
come.

As mentioned earlier, the global tech market did hit some challenges in recent times. Tech companies embarked on a 
spree of massive layoffs - hence optimizing and cutting cost - which led to more profits for them(some of them I guess).

This problem resulted in a noticable caution towards hiring - especially in core technical aspects like development/software engineering.

**Companies are no longer hiring as much.**
> The fact that hiring is at a "caution-level" currently, simply means it will be quite more challenging to get that top web3 job
of your dream as soon as possible. You have to be the "ideal, top web3 job candidate" **as much as possible**.

## Becoming the "ideal, top web3 jobs candidate"

There are quite a number of interesting web3 roles that one can apply from irrespective of your background or experience - especially 
if you're from a non-technical/engineering background. 

The challenge lies in **How to prepare and position yourself well enough to get hired**.

This article shares some valuable light on how to do just that. 

In this piece, I'll be sharing some awesome tips as well as first-hand information gotten from webinar I attended which featured top 
web3 recruiters. You'll get to discover key qualities that web3 recruiters seek in the candidates they hire.

I hope it helps.

**Below are three key points to help you build that "ideal, top web3 job" candidate portfolio.**

### 1. Passion for the web3 space.

It's quite stange, but one **"key quality"** that keeps getting mentioned in web3 hiring, is **passion for the web3 space**.

I really can't tell the reson for this, but I believe it makes so much sense anyhow.

Web3 is cool and awesome, but one honest suggestion I wish to share is that: you should ensure to have a passion for the web3
space before applying to any web3 job. 

Always do your best to research companies you're applying to - with an intent to know what they're building or working on 
if it aligns with your passion, and also, so as to practically develop an interest/passion for what they're building or
working on. **This alone will give you an edge in the application and interview process**.

> Strive to be passionate about the web3 space. Immerse yourself in learning about the web3 space as this will help you build
interest in the space.

One reason why I'm passionate about the web3 space, is how it greatly promotes transparency in a way that is 
largely(un-manipulate-able) - if implemented correctly. 

If you're from Nigeria like I am, you will know why this means a lot - especially in governance.

Web3(blockchain technology in particular) intrigues me a lot.

> You should find your own passion in the web3 space. I strongly believe that your passion for the space is something that cannot be
faked, so take time to build it - if that is something you currently lack.

Below are some extra important points to note:

- You should be willing to get paid in cryptocurrency if you get hired. Being the "no coiner" type who
will prefer to get paid in fiat, might be a statement that you're not passionate about the space, or that you do not
believe in the web3 industry.
- You should have knowledge of basic blockchain/web3 chores like: sending and recieving crypto funds, managing wallets and keys,
swapping tokens on exchanges, exchanging crypto for fiat, and more.
- Have good understanding of what blockchains are and how they operate. Also do well to have a good understanding of blockchain concepts 
like: Defi, NFTs(ERC-721s) - how they are valuable beyond just images or art work, Tokens(ERC-20s), consensus systems/mechanisms(PoW(proff of work) 
and PoS(proff of stake)) and more.

### 2. Experience and work qualifications.

Now, just like hiring in every other sectors, this is actually the real deal.

No one will hire you for fun. You're being hired to work. Hence, you need to have the required experience. It remains your duty to ensure
that you meet the minimum requirements for the role you're applying to.

> I'd be very honest here. The current tech-job market is no longer as it once was. It's now harder than ever to pass and get hired with
bare "minimum requirements". You should do you best to be as over-qualified as possible on any web3 role you're applying to in 2024.

If you find yourself failing to meet minimum qualification for a number of web3 roles you've been applying to or hope to begin applying 
to, I'll rather advice that you avoid the frustration of getting serially turned down or rejected, **by focusing on improving your 
skills and/or qualifications for some more time**. **Take some extra time to make your portfolio more robust.**

Either way, there is no harm in trying - you can proceed to send out applications if you wish. There are good chances you'll still 
get hired.

The following points should offer some more precise help.

- For technical/engineering professional: build relevant, **high-end** projects that are related to the web3 niche of the company or role
you're applying to. The key-word is **build**. You have to build project to strengthen your portfolio and prove that you have 
the relevant required skills. 
- You should consider increasing your chances of getting hired by narrowing down to certain niches in the space. Use keywords like "Defi 
specialist", "Token(ERC-20) developer/development specialist", "NFT(ERC-721) development specialist", 
"Web3 community management specialist", and more. Avoiding being a generalist can serve as a great advantage in your web3 job search.
- Finally, build excellent oral and communication skills - especially in English.

### 3. The application process.

One other very important part of every job search, is the application process.

Yes, with the help of AI, application processes are a lot more easier. But I won't recommend that you over-do the AI thing.

Many job applications today, are a bunch of concucted lies. Due to the fact that the letters/answers to questions 
were all AI-written, and not original experiences of the job applicants. This is a very terrible practice that I 
recommend you avoid if you wish to succeed in your application processes.

It's fine to use AI - you sure should, but be careful enough to make your applications as proper as possible.

> Recruiters are on the look-out for unique and outstanding job-applicants. Do your best to be as unique as possible when applying 
to new roles.

Below are some important points to help with your application process.

- Be as unique as possible in all your applications. Do anything that can help you stand out. Just be creative.

- Increase your chances by volunteering first. You can also try carrying out a research about a problem the company is currently 
facing, then providing a solution which you can share to impress everyone on the team.
- Connect: The web3 space is one big striving community. Web3 is an industry that strives on "community". Take advantage of this
knowledge, make a lot of web3 friends, strategically engage with their content on social media, share yours, and see what opportunities 
open up to you. Just in case you wish to learn more about how to explore job opportunities through networking

## Wrapping up

I hope this article has been a piece you've enjoyed. I also hope you've found enough value to help position you as an "ideal, 
top web3 job candidate".

To wrap this up, I wish to emphasize that even though I wish you only the best in your web3 job search. The 
process might not be as easy as you will wish. Either way, just keep pushing, and one crucial way to do so is to keep putting yourself 
out there by sharing content related to your niche/desired role. This goes a long way - creating a valid 
impression(of how qualified you are) in the minds of your audience - one of which might be your next employer.

> Professional jobs just like every other oportunities in life may not come easy - all you need is just one opportunity. 
You just have to keep doing your best until that opportunity comes. Simply always stay ready to prove your class whenever it does come.

Cheers! And all the best in your web3 job search.
