If you're not new to blockchain development, you must be aware of certain smart contract development suites or frameworks that help blockchain/web3 engineers with streamlining the process of creating and working with smart contracts.

Two very popular of such frameworks for [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) development are:

1. [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)
2. [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/)

On the [Solana](https://solana.com) blockchain, [Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com) is the default option.

> These smart contract suites, are development framework/tools that provide blockchain developers with the necessary stack of tools they need to work with smart contracts. They are simply all-in-one tools for interracting with smart contracts during development, testing, deployment.

## Anchor.

Anchor is simply to Solana, what Hardhat or Foundy is to Ethereum.

> Known as 'Solana's Sealevel runtime framework', Anchor is a robust framework for developing on-chain programs on Solana.

This article is not a full dive into the Anchor framework - we'll begin heading deeper from the next article of the series. The goal of this article is to introduce the series, while getting you prepared with all the necessary requirments to help you make the best of the course.

## Course/Series requirements.

To follow along and make the best of this tutorial series, it is assumed that you are currrently(or at least **currently interested in**) learning smart contract development on the Solana blockchain, and hope to enhance that process with Anchor.

If your goal is to learn smart contract development for Ethereum, then you should check out the Web3 Mastery [tutorial series for Hardhat](https://web3mastery.org/posts/hardhat) or [the one for Foundry](https://web3mastery.org/posts/foundry).

As earlier stated, Anchor is a framework for building smart contracts/programs on the Solana blockchain.

**Below are some other important requirements before proceeding with the series.**

### It is expected that you know Rust.

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) is the default programming language for writing smart contracts on solana. I assume it is due to this fact, that Solana smart contract are quite often referred to as 'programs' instead of 'smart contracts'.

Certainly, Anchor is no exception when it comes using Rust. 

To follow along with this series, It is recommended that you at least have some foundational knowledge of programming with Rust.

Just in case you do not know Rust, I'll suggest you take a pause right here, and learn some Rust first. [The Web3 Mastery Rust Bootcamp](https://web3mastery.org/posts/rust) will certainly be an awesome resource to help you get started with your Rust programming journey.

### You should know some Javascript.

As earlier stated, smart contract developent suites like Hardhat, Anchor, and Foundry, go beyond just helping you write smart contracts. They also provide a safe bed for testing you smart contracts.

To test your smart contracts in Anchor, you'll need some knowledge of Javascript, because Anchor utilizes the [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) testing framework by default - for testing programs.

> Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework that runs on Node.js and in the browser. You can learn more about Mocha [here](https://mochajs.org/). 

Anchor also comes preinstalled with [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) - another javascript based testing tool.

**Aside testing your smart contracts, it is almost a compulsory requirments in the blockchain development ecosystem - that you have some knowledge of Javascript.**

We recommend that you do take a pause, and stuff-in some javascript knowledge before proceeding with this series.

### You should preferably be using a Linux OS, a Mac OS, or WSL on Windows.

Solana development does not favour the use of the Windows operating system. Hence it is recommended that you're using either a Mac, or a Linux Operating system.

An alternative - if you only have access to a Windows PC, is to use [WSL(Windows Sub-system for Linux)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) on Windows. The [Web3 Mastery WSL Hand-book](https://web3mastery.org/posts/wsl) will be a great resource to help you get past this hurdle. 

## Conclusion.

With these checks all ticked out, you should be very ready to proceed with taking on this Anchor tutorial series.

> If there is any other requirement to help you proceed with the series, you'll definitely be guided on how to go about that.

Without any delay, let's proceed to install Anchor, and continue with the Journey.

Cheers!
