[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a low-level(systems) programming language that is currently taking the global programming
ecosystem by storm. 

In the [Stack Overflow Developer Survey of 2023](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/), 
Rust emerged as the most admired programming language by developers. In 
[the same survey of just a year prior(2022)](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022), Rust was on it's 7th time as the most loved 
programming language.

Indeed, Rust is one of the most impressive programming languages in the market currently.

> In this article, I'll be sharing as much as possible(as an introduction) about Rust, to get you 
informed, prepared, and thrilled-up as you proceed with this awesome Rust tutorial series.

## More About Rust.

Rust is a modern low-level programming language that is designed to provide high performance/speed and productivity, 
while also ensuring safety and reliabilty. It is a general-purpose programming language that can be used across different industries.
Rust offers a variety of features that makes it a great choice for a wide-range of projects.

Originally a personal project created by [Graydon Hoare](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/graydon-hoare) in 2006, Rust gained sponsorship 
from Mozilla in 2009. Since then, the stellar programming language continues to make giant strides while also winning many hearts. After it's 
first stable release in 2015, Rust has been adopted by top companies including: Amazon, Discord, Dropbox, Google, Meta, and Microsoft.

> As a proff of it super-impressive abilities, Rust became the first programming language aside C and Assemby to be supported in the 
> development of the **Linux Kernel** in December of 2022.

## Features/Awesomeness Of Rust.

Below are some awesome and super-impressive features and provisions that makes the Rust programming language stand out.

### 1. Rust Is Statically And Strongly Typed.

Unlike programming languages like [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and [Python](https://www.python.org/), 
Rust is both statically typed, and strongly typed. This means, it insists that the data type for every variable/value must be known at compile 
time(static typing), and also enforces restrictions on converting between data types(strong typing).

### 2. Compiles to Machine code.

Thanks to the Rust compiler, Rust code compiles into binary executable files(machine code), which 
makes it suitable for hardware programming. This also enables it to be a great fit for programming low-latency systems that require 
extreme speed, efficiency and high security.

### 3. Memory Safety Without A Garbage Collector.

Rust offers a very impressive level of programming safety - avoiding the security 
vulnerabilities and memory shortcomings of other system-level languages like [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) and 
[C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B). Rust achieves it's impressive memory safety
by using the concept of  "ownership". 

> [Ownership](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html) is considered 
to be Rust's most unique feature, it enables Rust to ensure memory safety without needing a garbage collector.

### 4. Establishing a balance between powerful technical capacity(low-level complexity) and a great developer experience(high-level convenience).

Rust is an awesome programming language that combines the high-level ergonomics that make for a great developer experience, with 
low-level control - a relieving feature that other "complex" low-level programming languages have long been unable to provide. 

> Rust provides the option to control low-level details (such as memory usage) without all the hassle traditionally associated with 
such control.

### 5. High Speed, Efficiency And Reliability. 

Rust is well known for it's high speed. Thanks to it's memory-safety prowess and it's strict error checks(thanks 
to a very impressive compiler), Rust is also known to be highly reliable and efficient. It is designed to naturally guide 
the programmer towards reliable code that is efficient in terms of speed and memory usage.

### 6. Productivity enhancement.

In terms of productivity enhancements, Rust is very impressive. From having a great documentation, to it's friendly compiler with very 
useful and detailed error messages and more, Rust is a great choice if productivity is you concern.

Other productivity enhancement reasons for trying out Rust include: 

- An increasingly loyal community/fan-base to help out when you're stuck.
- An integrated package manager called [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/)(think [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) for Javascript).
-   Impressive multi-editor support 
- An auto-formatter([rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt)).

And more...

## Rust Versions.

Since it's first stable release in 2015, Rust have had many new version releases.

Fortunately, newer [Rust versions](https://releases.rs/) are backward compatible with previous ones. Hence, even though newer version 
might introduce new features, fixes, and/or enhancements, older versions should still work just fine.

> At the time of writing this article, the latest Rust version(s) are <mark>Version 1.79.0(Beta) and Version 1.78.0(stable)</mark>.
Hence most or all of this tutorial series will be built with the latest stable version(Version 1.78.0).

## Use cases for Rust.

Versatility And a wide range of application are some other massive advantages of Rust.

Beyond low/system level work, Rust can be applied to engineer different systems. It is flexible and expressive enough, hence can 
be used to build CLI based applications, web servers and networking services. Rust can also be used in [WebAssembly(WASM)](https://webassembly.org/) 
and embedded systems engineering. 

> Best of all(most importantly for us here at Web3 Mastery), Rust is also used extensively in the 
world of web3/blockchain engineering.

Rust enables you to build skills that transfer from one domain to another. For example, you can learn Rust by writing a web app, 
and then proceed to applying those same skills while working on a Raspberry pi machine.

## Rust Adoption And Support.

Rust is used by different top companies across the world. Companies like: Amazon, Microsoft, Meta(formerly Facebook), Dropbox, 
Cloudflare and Mozilla have all adopted Rust for use in their projects.

Rust is currently one of the most desired and admired programming languages in the world. It has also been tipped to become the default build 
language for Javascript infrastructure/build tools.

With a great documentation and a supportive community/ecosystem, Rust continues to be a very promising programming language.

## Rust And Web3.

As earlier stated, Rust is used extensively in web3/blockchain engineering. It is currently the native/default language for 
programming smart contracts on the [Solana blockchain](https://solana.com/).

Aside it's direct application to web3, Rust can also be heavily applied(due to it's strategic advantagies) in building blockchain
infrastructure for web3.

> This turorial series will wrap up by guiding you into building web3/blockchain related projects with Rust.

## Proceeding With This Tutorial Series.

After all the impressive things you've learnt about Rust in this article, I suppose you're the more excited about proceeding with this 
tutorial series.

The next few articles in the series will show how to install Rust on your device. No need to worry, as there will be installation 
guides for the three main operating systems(Window, Mac OS, and Linux). 

## Conclusion.

To wrap this up, I encourage you to follow through the series as patiently as possible. Be patient enough to 
practice every shared concept. Ensure to follow through with every project that will be added as part of the 
series.

I trust you'll have a good time learning Rust with thisa awesome tutorial series.

See you in the next article. 

Cheers!
