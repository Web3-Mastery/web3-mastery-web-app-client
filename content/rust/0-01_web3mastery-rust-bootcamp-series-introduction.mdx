So you finally decided to become a Rustacean ðŸ˜Š. All I can say is, **'welcome to the club'**.

Whatever it is that initiated your interest in learning Rust, I must assure you that this Rust bootcamp(tutorial series) will certainly be a special resource to help you crush that goal. Web3 Mastery hopes to help you make the best of your Rust adventure.

This bootcamp is a strategic resource that was created in line with a robust curriculum to enable learners get a foundation understanding of programming with Rust. The series covers Rust from basic/general programming concepts like data types, variables, functions and more, into deeper and more Rust-specific concepts like the borrow-checker and others.

By the end of this course, you should be armed with sufficient knowledge to proceed with pursuing your specific career purpose of learning Rust - be it blockchain development on Solana, backend engineering, embeeded systems, or any other.

This article is not a deep-dive introduction into the Rust programming language(we'll have that in the next article). It is meant to serve as a introduction to the series, as well as a course requirement guide to help you discover all you need make the best of the series.

> Despite it's challenging concepts and strict/opinionated nature, Rust is an awesome programming language - one you can almost call 'perfect'. With so much in place to ensure you write programs that are as safe as possible, Rust only ends up leaving you falling more and more in love with it.

## Course requirements.

To make the best out of this tutorial series, it is expected that you at least have some previous programming experience, with **basic understanding** of different programming concepts like variables, functions, data-types, and more. It'll be even more perfect if you know [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) or if you have previous experience with a fully(strongly and statically) typed programming language.


> It is very possible to follow through even if you're a total newbie/beginner. But following this series will be a lot more favourable if you already have previous programming experience with at least one programming language.
>
>Eitherway, you **do not** need to have any previous experience working with Rust.

The series will also follow through(in a thorough fashion) with solid and relevant examples/projects to help you learn and master every shared concept as perfectly as possible.

I wish you a great learning experience.

## Conclusion.

> Do well to check and explore our other courses/tutorial series on [Solidity](https://www.web3mastery.org/posts/solidity),
