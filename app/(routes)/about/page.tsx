              Since coming into web3 and becoming a blockchain developer over a
              year ago, I've continued to be fascinated by the ingenious
              technology that powers this(web3) space - I've remained passionate
              about web3 and blockchain technology.
            </ParagraphElement>
            <ParagraphElement>
              Despite all the passion and love for the space, my engagements and
              continued growth as a full-stack(web2) software engineer continued
              to create a gap between me and web3.
            </ParagraphElement>
            <ParagraphElement>
              So I decided to change that in 2024 by becoming a web3-heavy
              full-stack software engineer.
            </ParagraphElement>
            <ParagraphElement>
              After some serious refresher and upgrading of my web3/blockchain
              skils in 2024, I was certainly ready for jobs/opportunities in the
              web3 space - especially thanks to my gift of brilliance, and my
              prior software engineering skills/experience in web2. Hence, as a
              way to both keep me continuously engaged in the space - building a
              better portfolio, while also continuing to show and share my web3
              expertise, I decided to build Web3 Mastery.
            </ParagraphElement>
            <ParagraphElement>
              Beyond all that, building Web3 Mastery aligns with my
              tech-obsession of building and scaling startups
            </ParagraphElement>
            <ParagraphElement>
              Web3 Mastery is a web3 education platform that aims to help build
              the next generation of blockchain developers and web3 netizens. It
              is a platform on a mission to build a base where all categories of
              blockchain/web3 folks - veterans, mid-level folks, and beginners
              alike, will readily come on - to learn and to also find and share
              opportunities.
            </ParagraphElement>
            <ParagraphElement>
              For now, you can explore(learn and get informed) from an array of
              awesome articles. But soon(as more features continuing to ship-in
              fast), users will be able to access more awesomeness like job
              opportunities(smart-contract engineering, bug-bounties, audits
              etcetera), more features to foster better learning, and more.
